# Proposed AppalCart Night Owl Orange Route

### Boone is Bussin' Campaign

##### Map created by Caleb Brown

> Boone is Bussin' is a graduate student social action campaign aimed at expanding access to the AppalCart Night Owl transportation system.

As it currently stands, there are no AppalCart Night Owl Routes servicing East Boone, cutting off a large portion of town from late-night free transit.
Expanded access to the Night Owl AppalCart system will create safer pedestrian conditions, keep drunk drivers off the roads, and provide equitable access to public transportation that does not currently exist.

##### Proposed Route Changes
- Amend overall route path to drive Old 421 to Industrial Park
    - Services Turtle Creek West apartment complex
    - Does not add significant time or cost of operation to Orange Route runs
- Additional stops added at Blue Ridge Tourist Court and Old 421/ US 421
    - Old 421 / US 421 will service new apartment complexes off Bub Teems Rd with short walk
